# 🔧 Monitoring Dashboard Fixes

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Monitoring Dashboard Showing Only 50 Logs Instead of 100**

**Problem**: The monitoring dashboard was defaulting to show only 50 logs, even though you had 100 total inference logs (50 from each model).

**Root Cause**:

- Frontend default limit was set to 50
- Backend maximum limit was capped at 200
- No proper model filtering was being applied

**Fixes Applied**:

- ✅ **Frontend**: Increased default limit from 50 to 200
- ✅ **Backend**: Increased maximum limit from 200 to 500
- ✅ **Database**: Increased maximum limit from 100 to 1000
- ✅ **UI**: Added better filter options (50, 100, 200, 500)

### 2. **Total Requests Not Updating**

**Problem**: The total requests count wasn't updating properly when new inference logs were added.

**Root Cause**:

- Monitoring dashboard wasn't being passed a `modelId` prop
- Filtering logic wasn't preserving the model ID
- Statistics were calculated on filtered results instead of all logs

**Fixes Applied**:

- ✅ **Model Filtering**: Fixed `modelId` preservation in filters
- ✅ **Statistics Calculation**: Improved calculation logic
- ✅ **UI Indicators**: Added model ID badge to show which model is being monitored
- ✅ **Refresh Button**: Added manual refresh capability

### 3. **Filtering Issues**

**Problem**: Model-specific filtering wasn't working properly.

**Root Cause**:

- `modelId` wasn't being properly passed through the filter chain
- Filter state wasn't updating when `modelId` changed

**Fixes Applied**:

- ✅ **Filter State**: Fixed `modelId` preservation in filter state
- ✅ **Dependencies**: Added `modelId` to useEffect dependencies
- ✅ **Filter UI**: Added model ID input field for global monitoring
- ✅ **Clear Filters**: Added clear filters functionality

## 🚀 How to See All 100 Logs Now

### **Option 1: Global Monitoring Dashboard**

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/monitoring`
2. Increase the "Limit" filter to **200** or **500**
3. Click the **"Refresh"** button
4. You should now see all **100 logs** (50 from each model)

### **Option 2: Model-Specific Monitoring**

1. Go to a specific model's detail page
2. Click on the **"Monitoring"** tab
3. The dashboard automatically filters by that model
4. You should see **50 logs** for that specific model

### **Option 3: Use the API Directly**

```bash
# Get all logs (up to 500)
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/models/logs?limit=500"

# Get logs for specific model
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/models/logs?model_id=model_1_example-model-test&limit=200"
```

## 📊 Current Log Distribution

After running the regeneration script:

```
📈 Current Inference Log Counts:
==================================================
Total logs in system: 100

📊 model_2_my-ml-model: 50 logs
📊 model_1_example-model-test: 50 logs
```

## 🔄 Regeneration Script

I created `regenerate_test_data.py` to:

- ✅ Clear existing logs
- ✅ Create fresh baseline data for both models
- ✅ Generate 50 inference logs for each model
- ✅ Show current log counts
- ✅ Provide instructions for viewing logs

**To regenerate test data**:

```bash
cd MLOPS
python3 regenerate_test_data.py
```

## 🎯 Key Improvements Made

### **Frontend (`monitoring-dashboard.tsx`)**:

- ✅ Increased default limit from 50 to 200
- ✅ Added refresh button with loading state
- ✅ Fixed model ID filtering logic
- ✅ Added model ID badge indicator
- ✅ Improved filter UI with clear filters option
- ✅ Added model ID input for global monitoring

### **Backend (`models.py`)**:

- ✅ Increased maximum limit from 200 to 500
- ✅ Improved error handling and statistics calculation
- ✅ Added better response structure

### **Database (`database.py`)**:

- ✅ Increased maximum limit from 100 to 1000
- ✅ Improved filtering logic with safe dictionary access
- ✅ Better timestamp sorting

## 🧪 Testing the Fixes

1. **Verify Log Counts**:

   - Global monitoring should show 100 logs with limit=200
   - Model-specific monitoring should show 50 logs each

2. **Test Filtering**:

   - Status filter should work (success/error)
   - Model ID filter should work in global view
   - Clear filters should reset to defaults

3. **Test Refresh**:
   - Refresh button should reload data
   - Loading state should show during refresh

## 📝 Next Steps

The monitoring dashboard should now properly display all your inference logs. If you need to add more logs or test different scenarios, you can:

1. **Add more logs**: Modify the `regenerate_test_data.py` script
2. **Test drift detection**: The logs now have intentional drift for testing
3. **Monitor real-time**: Use the refresh button to see new logs as they're added

All issues have been resolved! 🎉
